Additional Training Exercises for Students

## python_full_walkthrough
### How were these notes created?
Instructor rubber ducks concepts with rheotorical qns(eg. What is 
Python?) --> uses slides as a guide to unpack salient points(eg. general 
purpose) --> transits to get student to screenshare for setup --> then 
write notes as comments in the student's python file,  as the student 
progressively learns more syntax/programming concepts.

Programming language is the expression of concepts. In my limited experience, syntax mastery is important when crunching deadlines (eg. need 
to rush out production-grade endpoints with proper code coverage), but as a beginner, understand the underlying concepts expressed in the language 
is much more important. For instance, student needs to first understand the concept of control structures(loops), how we all want different 
responses to different situations, before he or she can unpack the syntax of if-else, for, while, then more detailed concepts like for-else, while-else etc.

From my 3 years of teaching basic computer programming to adults 
from all walks of life, I think it is important to exercise empathy to 
intuit the learning speed of the students as the class progresses. Usually 
we have more room for "reading our students" in a 1-1 setting, but in a 
bigger class, say 5 students, skills required to transmit information to 
each student is "quite different", maybe more shallow understanding? 
Really depends, I find it difficult to characterise the difference of 
class execution in classes of various sizes. Will revisit in time. 

## Raspberry Pi 
Oh RPi is alot more different - less "depth in concepts" and alot more in 
terms of unpacking physical structure - eg. reading the breadboard 
structure and seeing which parts of the metal are linked, which are not. 
Instructor exercises alot more "spirit" and waypointing to help the 
students see for themselves how to use the new component. In terms of 
embedded programming on the RPi, instructors may need to quickly unpack 
programming concepts without going in depth eg. `while True:` tells the 
system we want this python program to execute forever unless stopped by 
user manually. This is just one of dozens of intuitions need to conduct an 
RPi class of various sizes. Many parameters involved. Will revisit in 
time.
